MobileRedirect


This is a javascript/jQuery script that will redirect to a mobile site if a cookie is not found. If they came from the mobile site they will be shown an option to go back to the mobile site. Includes two different versions. One works by detecting user agents by using script from: http://detectmobilebrowsers.com/ other works by detecting pixel size under 600px (or whatever you want to set it too)

Functions are included to delete the cookie and to set a cookie so you can send users to the full site.
